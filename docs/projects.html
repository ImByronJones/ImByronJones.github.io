              <span>Video Game Auto-Accepter (Python)</span>
              <p class="description">I love playing video games, and one of my favorite games
                is League of Legends (as seen in the video). Sometimes when I queue up for a game,
                I'm not on my computer causing me to miss my game. This gave me the idea
                to create an auto-accepter. <br>
                <br>
                Description: In the video, the cursor/mouse is left on idle meaning the user (me in this
                case) isn't controling it. Once the match is found, using image processing through
                OpenCV, PyAutoGUI moves the cursor to the accept button and clicks it. The reason for the
                delay is because the program checks for that accept button every 5 seconds.

              <p class="description">This is my version of the casino game "Blackjack."
                I enjoy playing card games and this was one I wanted to make on the computer.
                Using my skills in C++, I developed my own version of Blackjack using the SFML library.

                Description: The red button initializes the game. The purple button is the stand/stop.
                The black button is to draw cards.

              <p class="description">As someone who is curious and wanting to learn new things,
                I took the opportunity to learn Python. Also, as someone who likes to play games,
                I use this visualizer to help me maintain an appropriate volume so my parents don't get
                mad at me for screaming.
                <br>
                <br>
                Description: As I speak into the mic, the audio is processed with PyAudio and NumPy. The calculations
                are then displayed on a graph through Matplotlib.

              <p class="description">This was a class project that I had to work on. This project
                was the most impactful as it has taught me a lot about data structures while
                utilizing all the concepts I've learned.
                <br>
                <br>
                Description: I am given a text file with a large amount of student names and their 
                information. I then search any student from the file along with their student number
                and find them. If the student doesn't exist, it is prompted on the command line. The
                program emphasizes the quick lookup time by a hashmap I created.
